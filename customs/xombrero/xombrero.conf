## GENERAL SETTINGS

#
# The strategy for the config file is as follows:
#
# Boolean values are the opposite of the default and need to simply be
# uncommented to alter the default.
#
# Text values *are* set to the default and in order to change them one must
# uncomment the option *and* change the value.
#

# NOTE: browser_mode and gui_mode MUST be the first entries in this
# file!

# Normal browser operation (default).
# browser_mode		= normal

# Prevent tracking operation.
 browser_mode		= whitelist

# Classic GUI (default).
