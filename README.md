Niminal
=======

An Ubuntu fork that fits my (minimal?) needs perfectly.

-=-=-=-=Background=-=-=-=-

Linux, so far, has been a real Goldilocks experience for me.

I started with Ubuntu. Liked it, but then the features started to kill my little netbook.

So I tried some of the others ones out. Arch, aptosid, Fedora, CentOS, Debian, Bodhi, Lubuntu, Gentoo, Sabayon, Slackware, and Tiny Core. They all either had a UI I couldn't quite dig, were too unstable, had security issues that (irrationally?) made me nervous, still had too many features, were a pain in the ass, etc.

Eventually, I decided to just go with OpenBSD...

...Only to find that my current hardware has a few compatibility issues.

So I decided to just make my own.

-=-=-=-=Guiding Principles=-=-=-=-

Stability.

Regular updates.

Security.

No compatibibility issues.

Minimal, but not featureless.

A good community I (and anyone using it) can turn to for help.

Ease of use.

-=-=-=-=Design=-=-=-=-

Taking all of these principles together, I decided to start with a minimal Ubuntu install, and build on top of that what I want. That way it would have Ubuntu's stability, regular update schedule, security, compatibility, ease of use, a great community, but none of the bloat.

(I could have just as easily gone with Debian's minimal install--and one day I'll make a Debian Niminal fork--but for now I know Ubuntu best, so Ubuntu it is.)

I pretty much took all of the packages from Lubuntu that I liked, added a few of my own, and slapped it all into a script.

(One day I'll get a site and an .iso for this.)

-=-=-=-=Install=-=-=-=-

THIS PROJECT IS NOWHERE NEAR READY. THE INSTALL SCRIPT WILL NOT RUN SUCCESSFULLY YET!!!

NOVICES SHOULD NOT--I REPEAT, NNNNNNNOOOOOOOOTTTTTTT--TRY TO INSTALL THIS!

Because there's nothing to install. It's just a half-finished bash script I put up so that I can continue working on it from a different machine.

That said, if you're a hacker, you're more than welcome to peruse--though if you're a hacker, you probably have something better. I never claimed to be terribly good at this...
