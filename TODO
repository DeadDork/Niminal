(In no particular order.)

Immediate:
* Change Squid3 to Polipo (squid is eating WAY too much memory).
* Change 'local' to '.local' (stupid stupid stupid...)
* Setup mpd (yeah yeah yeah...).
* Configure irssi.
* Create file associations.
* Complete Documents/manuals directory (definitely github-able!):
	* if-then
	* bash
	* r
	* latex
	* sed
	* gawk
	* chmod
* Weird pause on start-up (does this for all minimal installs...).
* Startup & shutdown backgrounds.
* tmux.
* mutt (I'm using gmail right now, but I really should make the switch to the command line...).
* mixmaster.
* urlview.
* Automount USB drives.
* Add update notifier.
* Deprecate niminal into niminal-core with masks (niminal as is, is too top heavy).

Future:
* Niminal install script for non-minimal Ubuntu/Debian base installs.
* cabal install cabal-install
* Work out a way to easily, but securely, backup (and download into new Niminal installs) my documents & protected files.
* Phase out trayer and applet's completely
	* Power script (for quick shutdown, reboot, etc. from dmenu, etc.).
	* Power management through scripts (TLP?).
	* NM managent through scripts (the security--e.g. gnome-keyring-manager--is going to be a pain...).
	* Figure out why nm-applet isn't showing a graphic (obviously, I wouldn't have to worry about this if I go app-less).
	* get-flash-videos & xombrero.
* xmonad.hs (I'm pretty happy with my current xmonad.hs, but monad can do so much--check out and1's config at <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Config_archive/And1%27s_xmonad.hs>. Also, I like brisbin's config <https://github.com/pbrisbin/xmonad-config>, especially the idea of modularizing the various complex functions. Finally, I need to clean up my xmonad.hs. There are a lot of deprecated comments.)
* create small github repo's for the more complex, likely-to-be-regularly-updated config's & scripts.
	* vim
	* xmonad
* Cheatsheets:
	* xmonad
	* elinks
	* vimprobable
	* xombrero
	* chromium
	* vim
* review packages--i.e. I'm sure there are a couple that aren't needed.
* tighten up settings.
* security (harden?).
* stability (switch to debian, read on how to make the system more stable).
* Test niminal.sh on Ubuntu Desktop, Debian Desktop, and Debian net install.
* Create whole .deb package, configs and all (a script is a great first step, but it's another hurdle for people who might otherwise try out Niminal).
* Create deb ppa.  
* Create complete .iso.
* Documentation (user-friendly tutorial and links--again, the idea is to make it easy for newer users to enjoy a minimal setup).
* website (forum, patches, wiki, flyspray, etc.).
* vim colors in st & urxvt (even with 256 colors enabled, it looks like I'm using 88 colors).
* xmonad install script (i.e. make it also install xmonad.1...).
* Script for individualizing Niminal (i.e. if John Doe wants to try it out, the Niminal script should be able to prompt him a couple of question upon install, and then it's set up to use his favored IRC handle, etc.).
* Scripts for updating Niminal (as in, AFTER it has alreday been installed. That said, git pull on niminal, then running the script should do a pretty good job).
* Use an alternative login manager (this is presumably the source behind the xmonad toggleStrut bug. Whatever it is, it needs to be able to put the computer to sleep, suspect, shutdown, and reboot. OK, those are a lot of features...I might just have to live with LightDM...).
* Notifications (notify-osd, etc.). (I'm actually not sure of this. I'm not terribly enthusiastic of pop-up's, and having yet another daemon running in the background seems like a waste. Still, some people like guake, in which case, etc...)
