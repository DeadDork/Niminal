For now:
* Power management (I've ultimately decided to stick to xfce4-power-manager. I need to set up a default config file for vanilla Niminal, as well as test whether I need acpid [seems extraneous...])
* Network management (for this, too, I've decided to stick with the gui-er option, namely network-manager-gnome. Wicd might be great and all, but I like the gnome-keyring integration, as well as better hardware support, etc.)
* elinks (config patch)
* vimprobable (config patch)
* samba (config patch)
* xombrero (config patch)
* privoxy/squid3/tor (config patch)
* vim/vim-tiny/gvim (config patch)
* mutt (config patch)
* st (config patch)
* xmonad (config patch)
* review packages (policykit-desktop-privileges?)
* security (paranoia check)
* stability (paranoia check)
* test this mofo out!

In the fuuuuuuture:
* graphics
* Create complete .iso (UCK?)
* documentation
* tighten up defaults
* website (forum, patches, wiki, flyspray, etc.)
