* Use an alternative login manager (SLiM?).
* Startup & shutdown backgrounds.
* Fork Guake, and use st instead of whatever memory hog it uses right now.
* tmux (I'm not even sure what it does, but I suspect it's cool).
* Figure out why nm-applet isn't showing a graphic.
* Power script (for quick shutdown, reboot, etc. from dmenu, etc.).
* Phase out trayer and applet's completely
* Power management through scripts (TLP?).
* NM management through scripts (the security--e.g. gnome-keyring-manager--is going to be a pain...).
* mutt (I'm using gmail right now, but I really should make the switch to the command line...)
* xmonad (my current setup is unnecessarily ugly. xmonad can do so much--check out and1's config at <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Config_archive/And1%27s_xmonad.hs>).
* review packages--i.e. I'm sure there are a couple that aren't needed.
* tighten up settings.
* security (harden).
* stability (switch to debian, read on how to make the system more stable).
* Test niminal.sh on both Ubuntu Desktop, Debian Desktop, and Debian net install.
* Create complete .iso (UCK?)
* Documentation (so that anyone wanting to try out a minimal Linux distro can, and not have to spend way too much time reading documentation and how-to's).
* website (forum, patches, wiki, flyspray, etc.)
